# Thesis Code Repository<img src="logo_CUSAT.png" align="right" height="139" />

This repository is maintained to provide relevant codes corresponding to the chapters of my PhD thesis titled **"Some Contributions to Modelling and Analysis of Count Time Series"**.

## Chapters

- **Chapter 2: A Novel Geometric AR(1) Model**
- **Chapter 3: Coherent Forecasting of NoGeAR(1) Model**
- **Chapter 4: NoGe-INGARCH Model**
- **Chapter 5: Softplus Negative Binomial INGARCH Model**
- **Chapter 6: Neural Negative Binomial INGARCH Model**

## Implementation Details

Most of the code was implemented in **R**, but some programs, particularly certain **simulation exercises**, were executed in **MATLAB**.

Each chapter folder contains the corresponding R/MATLAB scripts and relevant supporting files.
