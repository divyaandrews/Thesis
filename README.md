# Thesis Code Repository

This repository is maintained to provide relevant codes corresponding to the chapters of my PhD thesis titled **"[Insert Thesis Title Here]"**.

## Chapters and Associated Code

- **Chapter 2: A Novel Geometric AR(1) Model**
- **Chapter 3: Coherent Forecasting of NoGeAR(1)**
- **Chapter 4: NoGe-INGARCH**
- **Chapter 5: Softplus Negative Binomial INGARCH**
- **Chapter 6: Neural Negative Binomial INGARCH**

## Implementation Details

Most of the code was implemented in **R**, but some programs, particularly certain **simulation exercises**, were executed in **MATLAB**.

Each chapter folder contains the corresponding R/MATLAB scripts and relevant supporting files.
